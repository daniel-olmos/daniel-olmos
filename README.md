# Hi, I'm Daniel Olmos (BigDan) 🤘

### Tech Founder | CTO | Software Architect

I build technology-driven businesses.

With 10+ years creating web products and digital ecosystems, I focus on turning complex ideas into scalable software companies. My work sits at the intersection of product vision, engineering execution, and business strategy — helping teams go from idea → MVP → scalable platform.
